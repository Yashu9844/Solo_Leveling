/**
 * The System, out loud.
 *
 * Built on the browser's own `speechSynthesis`, which is the only option
 * that keeps design/04's hard constraints intact: the voices are already
 * on the device, so this works with the network off, adds nothing to the
 * bundle, and never sends a line of the Player's state anywhere. A pack
 * of pre-rendered audio would have meant ~150 files and a download; a
 * cloud TTS call would have meant an online dependency for the app's
 * first paint. Neither is acceptable for an offline-first PWA.
 *
 * Two facts about the Web Speech API shape everything below:
 *
 *  1. `getVoices()` is empty on the first call in Chrome and fills in
 *     later, announced by `voiceschanged`. Any code that picks a voice
 *     synchronously on load gets the platform default forever.
 *  2. Mobile browsers refuse to speak until the document has seen a user
 *     gesture. A cold PWA launch has had none — so a line that is simply
 *     spoken on mount is silently dropped on exactly the platform this
 *     app is built for. `armOnFirstGesture` is the answer, not a retry.
