 * the entire desktop adaptation (design/00-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §8 rule 8).
 * `final/06` §6 originally called for a left rail at ≥1024px; that is
 * dropped, because a phone-shaped app stretched across a desktop reads
 * as broken, whereas a framed device reads as deliberate.
 *
 * Uses `dvh`, never `vh` — on mobile `100vh` is taller than the visible
 * viewport while the URL bar is showing, which pushes the bottom nav
 * off-screen exactly when a thumb reaches for it.
