/**
 * The quiet half of the Moment vocabulary.
 *
 * MASTERY and EVIDENCE ACCEPTED are not ceremonies. Both fire mid-
 * session, right after logging something, and final/05 §2.1 gives them
 * a 600ms card rather than a full screen precisely so they do not stop
 * what you were doing. This is that card, shared by both, so the two
 * cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Portalled, like everything else that has to escape a screen: both are
 * triggered from inside a log sheet, and that sheet is portalled too —
 * left in place the celebration would render underneath the form that
 * fired it.
 *
 * It sits above the bottom nav rather than over the sheet's content,
 * because the thing it is reporting on is still on screen behind it and
 * covering that would defeat the point.
