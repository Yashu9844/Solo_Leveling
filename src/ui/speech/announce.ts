/**
 * Saying one line, outside React's lifecycle.
 *
 * This used to live inside the effect in useSystemVoice, and that was a
 * bug with a very specific shape. The effect claimed the line, awaited
 * playback, and only armed the first-gesture fallback if playback had
 * failed *and* the effect had not been cleaned up:
 *
 *     const spoke = await say();
 *     if (spoke || cancelled) return;      // <- cancelled by StrictMode
 *     disarm = armOnFirstGesture(...);     // <- therefore never reached
 *
 * React StrictMode mounts, unmounts and remounts every component in
 * development. The unmount set `cancelled` before the await resolved, and
 * the remount saw the line already claimed and returned early — so on any
 * browser that blocks autoplay (which is every browser, on a page that
 * has not been touched yet) the fallback was never armed and the line
 * could never be heard, however many times the Player tapped.
 *
 * The fix is not a StrictMode workaround. It is to stop making arming
 * conditional on a race: **arm first, then try**, and disarm only once
 * sound has actually happened. Nothing here reads React state or depends
 * on a component still being mounted, so there is no lifecycle left to
 * lose the line to.
