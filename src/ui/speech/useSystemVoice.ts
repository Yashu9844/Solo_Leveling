 * announce.ts, outside React, because tying them to an effect's lifetime
 * is what broke this the first time: StrictMode's extra unmount cancelled
 * the fallback before it was armed, and the line became unreachable on
 * any browser that blocks autoplay. A hook that only forwards arguments
 * has no race to lose.
 *
 * A page reload is a new app open and the System greets you again; a
 * re-render, a tab round trip or a quest toggle inside the same state is
 * not, and stays silent — the fingerprint is already the identity of a
 * state (engine/systemVoice.ts), so that falls out rather than needing a
 * second rule.
