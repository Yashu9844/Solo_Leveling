/**
 * The front door, shown once: before an arc exists.
 *
 * A Gold Horizon surface — the promise, not the grind
 * (design/00-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md §2.2). Everything else on the boot path
 * is Blue Arc; this is the one place the app shows what the four months
 * are for rather than what they cost.
 *
 * The plate already carries three lines of its own — DISCIPLINE CREATES
 * FREEDOM, A BETTER YOU AWAITS, SMALL STEPS BIG WORLDS — so this screen
 * adds no tagline of its own. §2.4 rule 4: never overlay copy on art
 * that already speaks. Only the wordmark and the one action.
