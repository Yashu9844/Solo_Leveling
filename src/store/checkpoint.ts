// The Day-0 checkpoint row is created empty during onboarding
// (store/onboarding.ts) — self_efficacy: {}, automaticity: {}, enjoyment:
// {}. This module fills in self_efficacy from the carry-over instrument
// (final/11-SLICE-2-PROMPT.md Step 1; the spec gap was in docs/13, not
// final/, which is why Phase 0 didn't have it). automaticity and
// enjoyment stay {} — no instrument for either exists yet in any final/
// doc; left as an open gap, same shape as the other flagged omissions
// in this file below.
//
// Slice 12 — final/01 §4: rank gate evidence, sealing, and the export
// gate that blocks sealing. computeGateEvidence pulls every field
// engine/rank.ts's GateEvidence needs from real tables where the data
// exists (career, DSA, foundations, training, resume, system design —
// all real as of Slices 6-11; the four bossXCleared fields became real
// too in Slice 13, via store/boss.ts's getBossStatus). Two fields still
// have no data source ANYWHERE in this build and stay always false:
// costPerTaskMeasured and interviewBenchmarkPassed have no logging
// surface in any final/ doc. This is the safe direction — a gate
// depending on them can never over-report a rank it hasn't actually
// earned.
